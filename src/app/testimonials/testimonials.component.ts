      description: "Randy Cooley is the most able and trustworthy contractor we have ever had. Thirty-five years ago we moved into a house in Ann Arbor with distinguished architecture but needing much done to it. In project after project Randy has restored, remodeled, maintained, and enhanced it over many years.  He chooses the employees on his team with care.  He himself is a fine carpenter, able mason, and excellent painter, and his good taste shows in his advice. He has always been there for us in emergencies. He is a person of integrity and good judgment.  He will tell you what he thinks doesnâ€™t need to be done or done now, and is imaginative in solving difficult problems.  We give him the highest possible recommendation and will be happy to talk with anyone about our work with him.",

      description: "Only call Randy if you want your project to be done precisely, in a realistic amount of time and on budget.  Randy has done several projects for me over the last 15 years, including interior plaster and painting, exterior painting, carpentry and dry wall.  He is easy to communicate with, listens well, and offers suggestions when appropriate.   I knew when he was coming and when not to expect him.  He and his crew keep a clean workspace and are cognizant of the homeowners needs during construction.  Yes, I would highly recommend Randy Cooley.",
